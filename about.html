            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>YourHelpa was born from a simple idea: what if getting things done in Nigeria was as easy as sending a WhatsApp message? We were tired of the hassle of finding trustworthy professionals, the uncertainty of pricing, and the inconvenience of juggling multiple apps for simple tasks. We envisioned a single, reliable platform that connects people who need help with skilled individuals ready to provide it.</p>
            <p>Today, YourHelpa is a growing community of customers and "Helpas" built on a foundation of trust, security, and convenience. From fixing a leaky tap to finding the perfect birthday cake, we are your everyday plug for services and products, all managed through the simplicity of a chat.</p>
