                    <summary>How does the Escrow payment work?</summary>
                    <p>When you hire a Helpa, you pay the agreed amount to YourHelpa. We hold the funds securely. Only when you confirm on WhatsApp that the job is complete to your satisfaction do we release the payment to the Helpa. This eliminates risk for everyone.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What if I'm not satisfied with the work?</summary>
                    <p>Your satisfaction is our priority. If the work is not completed as agreed, do not approve the payment. Contact our support through the same WhatsApp chat, and we will mediate the dispute. Your funds remain safe in escrow until the issue is resolved.</p>

                    <summary>Is it free to request a service?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, it is completely free to make a request and get quotes from Helpas. You only pay for the service or product itself once you agree to the terms and hire a Helpa.</p>
