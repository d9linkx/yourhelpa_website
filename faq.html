                    <summary>What is YourHelpa?</summary>
                    <p>YourHelpa is a platform that connects you to trusted service providers (Helpas) and product vendors through WhatsApp. You can request a service, get quotes, and pay securely, all within a single chat conversation.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Is it free to request a service?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, it is completely free to make a request and get quotes from Helpas. You only pay for the service or product itself once you agree to the terms.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How do I pay for a service?</summary>
                    <p>All payments are handled securely through our platform. We will provide you with a secure payment link in your WhatsApp chat. We hold the payment until the task is completed to ensure your satisfaction.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How do you vet your Helpas?</summary>
                    <p>Every Helpa on our platform goes through a verification process, which includes identity checks and skill validation where applicable. We are committed to building a community of trusted and reliable professionals.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What happens if I'm not satisfied with the service?</summary>
                    <p>Your satisfaction is our priority. Since your payment is held in our secure Escrow, it is not released to the Helpa until you confirm the job is complete. If you're not satisfied, you can raise a dispute through our WhatsApp support, and we will mediate to ensure a fair resolution, which could include a partial refund or having the job redone.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How is the price for a service determined?</summary>
                    <p>You discuss and agree on a price directly with the Helpa in your WhatsApp chat. Helpas provide quotes based on your requirements. This ensures transparency, and you only fund the Escrow once you are happy with the agreed-upon price.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What if the final cost is different from the initial quote?</summary>
                    <p>If the scope of the job changes, the Helpa can request a price adjustment. This must be approved by you in the WhatsApp chat before any extra work is done. Any additional payment will also be processed securely through our Escrow system.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Is my payment information safe?</summary>
                    <p>Absolutely. We use industry-leading, PCI-compliant payment processors to handle all transactions. Your card or bank details are never stored on our servers, and all payments are encrypted and secure.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I cancel a job after I've paid?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, you can. If you cancel before the Helpa has started work or incurred costs, you are eligible for a full refund. If work has already begun, the refund amount will depend on the progress of the job. Our support team will help mediate a fair outcome.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How do I leave a review for a Helpa?</summary>
                    <p>After a job is completed and payment is released, you will be prompted on WhatsApp to leave a rating and a review for the Helpa. Your feedback is crucial for maintaining the quality of our network.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How do I become a Helpa?</summary>
                    <p>You can start by visiting our <a href="register.html">'Become a Helpa'</a> page and filling out the application form. You'll need to provide basic information, details about your skills, and a valid means of identification for our verification process.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What are the fees for being a Helpa?</summary>
                    <p>To ensure we only have serious professionals, we charge a ₦1,000 monthly subscription for access to pre-paid job leads. We also charge a 7% commission on successfully completed jobs. This commission funds the Escrow system that guarantees your payment.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How and when do I get paid?</summary>
                    <p>Instantly. As soon as the customer confirms on WhatsApp that the job is completed, your payment (minus the 7% commission) is immediately processed and transferred to your registered bank account. No more waiting or chasing payments.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What if a customer refuses to confirm job completion?</summary>
                    <p>This is a rare situation, but our Escrow system is designed to protect you. If a customer is unresponsive or unfairly refuses to confirm completion, you can escalate the issue to our support team. We will review the chat history and evidence of work to ensure you get paid for the job you've done.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I set my own prices?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, you can always set and adjust your prices and services on your <a href="login.html">Helpa dashboard</a>. That way, whenever the YourHelpa AI searches for products or services you offer, they'll find up to date information as set by you, and display them to your customer. You can also add an option on each service or product you sell to be open to negotiation, if it pleases you to do so. This way, customers can see that they can negotiate your price.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How does the AI matching work?</summary>
                    <p>Our system matches you with jobs based on your skills, service category, location, and your reputation on the platform (ratings and reviews). This ensures you receive relevant leads that you are well-suited to complete.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What if a customer asks for more work than we agreed on?</summary>
                    <p>You should never do extra work without a price adjustment. Politely inform the customer that the new request is outside the original scope and provide a quote for the additional work. You can request a payment adjustment through our system, which the customer must approve and fund before you proceed.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How can I improve my profile to get more jobs?</summary>
                    <p>A complete profile with a clear photo, detailed skill descriptions, and a portfolio of your past work can significantly boost your chances. Consistently delivering high-quality service to earn positive reviews is the best way to become a top-rated Helpa and get more job leads.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I pause my subscription?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. If you are going to be unavailable, you can simply choose not to renew your ₦1,000 monthly subscription. When you're ready to receive leads again, you can easily reactivate it.</p>
