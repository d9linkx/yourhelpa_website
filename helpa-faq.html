                    <summary>How and when do I get paid?</summary>
                    <p>Instantly. Once a customer confirms the job is complete via WhatsApp, our system automatically processes your payment. The funds (your agreed price minus the 7% commission) are transferred to your registered bank account immediately. No delays.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What are the fees for being a Helpa?</summary>
                    <p>We have a simple partnership model: a <strong>₦1,000 per month</strong> subscription to access our network of verified, pre-paid job leads, and a <strong>7% commission</strong> on each completed job. There are no other hidden charges.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Why is there a 7% commission on top of the subscription?</summary>
                    <p>The 7% commission is your business insurance. It funds the secure Escrow system that holds the customer's money, which guarantees you get paid 100% of the time for completed work. It also covers payment processing fees and the cost of our human-led dispute resolution team.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Who sets the price for a job?</summary>
                    <p>You do. The customer states their budget, and you provide a quote. The final price is an agreement between you and the customer, negotiated directly in the WhatsApp chat. YourHelpa does not set prices for you.</p>
                </details>
                 <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What if I need to buy materials for a job? How do I get paid for that?</summary>
                    <p>The cost of materials should be included in your final quote to the customer. Before you start, ensure the total amount locked in Escrow covers both your service fee and the cost of materials. This protects you from spending your own money without a guarantee of reimbursement.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What bank accounts are supported for payouts?</summary>
                    <p>We support payouts to any valid commercial bank account in Nigeria. During your registration, you will provide your bank details, which we secure for payment purposes.</p>

                    <summary>What documents do I need to sign up?</summary>
                    <p>You will need a valid form of national identification (like a NIN slip, Driver's License, Voter's Card, or International Passport) and your bank account details for payouts. This is to ensure everyone on the platform is a real, accountable person.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How long does the verification process take?</summary>
                    <p>Our verification process is fast. Once you submit your documents, it typically takes less than 24 hours for our team to review and approve your profile, after which you can start receiving job leads.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How does the AI match me with customers?</summary>
                    <p>Our AI matches you based on three key factors: the service you offer, your location, and your reputation (ratings). This ensures you get relevant job requests that are close to you from serious customers.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I offer more than one type of service?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. During registration, you can list all the skills and services you provide. This increases your chances of getting matched with a wider variety of job requests.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I reject a job request?</summary>
                    <p>Absolutely. You are in full control. If a job request doesn't fit your schedule, price, or requirements, you are free to decline it with no penalty. You only take the jobs you want.</p>
                </details>
                 <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Am I guaranteed to get jobs every month?</summary>
                    <p>While we work hard to bring a steady stream of customers to the platform, we cannot guarantee a specific number of jobs. Your success depends on customer demand in your area, the quality of your profile, your pricing, and your reputation (ratings).</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What if a customer cancels a job?</summary>
                    <p>If a customer cancels before you have started any work or incurred costs, the Escrow funds are returned to them and there is no penalty. If a dispute arises after work has begun, our support team will mediate to ensure you are fairly compensated for the work already completed.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What if a customer asks for more work than we originally agreed on?</summary>
                    <p>This is called "scope creep." You should immediately state in the WhatsApp chat that the new request is outside the original agreement and provide a quote for the additional work. Do not start the extra work until the customer agrees to the new price and the additional funds are added to Escrow.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How does the dispute resolution process work in detail?</summary>
                    <p>If you type "DISPUTE" in the chat, the Escrow funds are frozen. A human support agent is notified and will review the entire chat history, including the initial agreement, photos, and any other evidence. The agent then makes a fair decision on how to distribute the funds based on this evidence.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What kind of evidence is useful in a dispute?</summary>
                    <p>Clear communication is key. Use the WhatsApp chat to document everything: "before" and "after" photos, videos of the completed work, and clear text confirming the job scope and price. This creates a digital paper trail that protects you.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What happens if I damage a customer's property by accident?</summary>
                    <p>You are responsible for your work and any damages that may occur. We recommend having your own liability insurance. In case of an incident, you should communicate openly with the customer to find a resolution. If an agreement can't be reached, the dispute process can be initiated to mediate.</p>

                    <summary>How important are customer ratings?</summary>
                    <p>Extremely important. Your rating directly impacts how often you are matched with new jobs. Consistently high ratings build trust and lead to more, higher-paying job requests. Consistently low ratings can lead to account review and potential suspension.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What if I receive an unfair bad rating?</summary>
                    <p>If you believe a rating is unfair, you can report it to our support team. We will review the chat history and evidence. While we cannot remove a rating simply because you disagree with it, we will take action if a customer is found to be abusing the system.</p>

                    <p>Yes. You can manage your subscription status from your Helpa profile. You can pause your subscription if you will be unavailable for an extended period and reactivate it when you are ready to start receiving job leads again.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Do I need a smartphone to be a Helpa?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, a smartphone with WhatsApp is essential. The entire process—from receiving job leads to communicating with customers and confirming payments—happens on WhatsApp.</p>
